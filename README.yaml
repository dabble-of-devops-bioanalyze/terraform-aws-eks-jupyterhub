    description: |
      JupyterHub allows users to interact with a computing environment through a webpage. As most devices have access to a web browser, JupyterHub makes it is easy to provide and standardize the computing environment for a group of people (e.g., for a class of students or an analytics team).

      This project will help you set up your own JupyterHub on a cloud/on-prem k8s environment and leverage its scalable nature to support a large group of users. Thanks to Kubernetes, we are not tied to a specific cloud provider.

    description: |
      Dask Gateway provides a secure, multi-tenant server for managing Dask clusters. It allows users to launch and use Dask clusters in a shared, centrally managed cluster environment, without requiring users to have direct access to the underlying cluster backend (e.g. Kubernetes, Hadoop/YARN, HPC Job queues, etc…).

      This chart provides a multi-user, Dask-Gateway enabled JupyterHub. It combines the JupyterHub and Dask Gateway helm charts.
